# Coin Capture

This is a small game I wrote in JS using canvas.  The goal is to grab as many yellow coins as you can.  The difficulty gradually increases as you reach certain points thresholds.  

### WARNING:  If you typically have your speakers turned up really high for video conferences, the music may be quite loud when you start the game.
